# Individualized Risk Assessment of Preoperative Opioid Use by Interpretable Neural Network Regression0

## Overview

This project aims to understand the risk of preoperative opioid. A novel Interpretale Neural Network Regression (INNER) was proposed to conduct individualized risk assesment of preoperative opioid use. Intensive simulations and statistical analysis of 34,186 patients expecting surgery in the Analgesic Outcomes Study (AOS) show that the proposed
