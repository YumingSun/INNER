# Individualized Risk Assessment of Preoperative Opioid Use by Interpretable Neural Network Regression

## Overview

This project aims to understand the risk of preoperative opioid. A novel Interpretale Neural Network Regression (INNER) is proposed to conduct individualized risk assesment of preoperative opioid use. Intensive simulations and statistical analysis of 34,186 patients expecting surgery in the Analgesic Outcomes Study (AOS) show that the proposed INNER not only can accurately predict the preoperative opioid use based on preoperative characteristics as deep neural network (DNN), but also can estimate the patient-specific odds of opioid use without pain and the odds ratio of opioid use for one  unit increase in  the reported overall body pain, leading to more straightforward interpretations on opioid tendency compared to DNN.
